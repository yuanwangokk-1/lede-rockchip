Subject: [PATCH] regulator: rk808: fix asynchronous probing

If the probe routine fails with -EPROBE_DEFER after taking over the
OF node from its parent driver, reprobing triggers pinctrl_bind_pins()
and that will fail. Fix this by setting of_node_reused, so that the
device does not try to setup pin muxing.

For me this always happens once the driver is marked to prefer async
probing and never happens without that flag.

Fixes: 259b93b21a9f ("regulator: Set PROBE_PREFER_ASYNCHRONOUS for drivers that existed in 4.14")
